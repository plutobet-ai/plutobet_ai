 * persists across restarts, unlike the ephemeral cluster the test suite
 * spins up.
 *
 * It reproduces the PRODUCTION ROLE SPLIT rather than running everything as a
 * superuser: migrations run as an owner, the app connects as a non-owner
 * member of app_role. That split is what makes the ledger's REVOKEs mean
 * anything, and a dev environment that ignores it hides exactly the class of
 * bug those grants exist to catch.

/**
 * Creates the database in UTF8, whatever the cluster's own encoding is.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT THE DEFAULT AND WHY IT MATTERS. `embedded-postgres` runs
 * `initdb` with the machine's locale, and on a Windows host that is
 * `English_United States.1252` — so `template1`, and every database cloned
 * from it, is WIN1252. Production is UTF8.
 *
 * The consequence is not theoretical. A payout approval whose written reason
 * contained a naira sign — the currency this product is denominated in, printed
 * on every screen — failed with
 *
 *   character with byte sequence 0xe2 0x82 0xa6 in encoding "UTF8"
 *   has no equivalent in encoding "WIN1252"
 *
 * and the administrator saw a 500 on a sensitive action that works perfectly in
 * production. Found by a browser test, because nothing else had ever written a
 * naira sign, an accented customer name or an emoji into a column.
 *
 * A local stack that fails where production succeeds is bad; the same stack
 * SUCCEEDING where production would fail would be worse, and either way the
 * disposable database has to have production's encoding or it is not a rehearsal.
 *
 * `template0` with `LC_COLLATE`/`LC_CTYPE` of `C` is the only combination that
 * can be created regardless of what the cluster was initialised with.
