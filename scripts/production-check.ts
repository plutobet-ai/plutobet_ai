/**
 * Launch readiness, reported without ever printing a value.
 *
 *   npm run production:check                      # DEMO readiness (default)
 *   npm run production:check -- --mode=real-money # REAL-MONEY readiness
 *   npm run production:check -- --remote=https://your-app.up.railway.app
 *
 * TWO MODES, BECAUSE THEY ARE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS
 * -----------------------------------------------
 * `demo` asks: can this serve a test account end to end — real fixtures, real
 * odds, a QA-credited bet, automatic settlement — with no real money involved?
 *
 * `real-money` asks: may this take a stranger's money? That needs payment
 * credentials, notification delivery, identity verification, credential
 * rotation, a proven restore, error reporting and a gaming licence. None of it
 * is implied by the demo passing.
 *
 * The distinction exists because a report once said "NEXTAUTH_URL is the only
 * remaining launch blocker". It was the only blocker THIS CHECKER COULD SEE,
 * which is a very different sentence, and the gap between them is where a
 * platform gets launched before it is legal to operate.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS FOR
 * --------------
 * `/api/health` answers "is this deployment serving?" from inside the running
 * app. This answers the earlier question: "is this environment configured well
 * enough to deploy at all?" — including the pieces health cannot see, such as
 * whether the migration role differs from the runtime role, whether Redis is a
 * TCP URL rather than a REST one, and whether the scheduler has ever succeeded.
 *
 * THE RULE
 * --------
 * No value is ever printed. Not truncated, not masked, not "first four
 * characters" — those leak too, and a launch checklist gets pasted into chat
 * far more often than a log does. Every finding is one of:
 *
 *   PRESENT      set and structurally usable
 *   MISSING      not set
 *   INVALID      set but structurally wrong (wrong scheme, too short, REST URL)
 *   UNVERIFIED   could not be checked from here (no access, not deployed yet)
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 launch-ready, 1 a launch-blocking dependency is missing or
 * invalid, 2 the checker itself failed.
