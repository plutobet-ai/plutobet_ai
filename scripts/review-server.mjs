/**
 * The review server: a production build on a DISPOSABLE LOCAL DATABASE.
 *
 *   node scripts/review-server.mjs            # port 3100
 *   node scripts/review-server.mjs --port=3200
 *
 * This is what the Playwright suite and the screenshot capture run against.
 *
 * WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS RATHER THAN A SHELL ONE-LINER. `next start` loads
 * `.env`, and in this repository `.env` holds PRODUCTION credentials. Starting
 * the review server by exporting a local `DATABASE_URL` in front of the command
 * works, but it is one forgotten export away from pointing a browser — and the
 * destructive interaction tests — at the real database, and the failure is
 * silent because the app comes up perfectly either way.
 *
 * So the safety is asserted here instead of remembered:
 *
 *   1. Every connection string is set EXPLICITLY. Shell env beats `.env` in
 *      Next.js, so nothing production-shaped can leak in through the file.
 *   2. The host of every one is CHECKED. A URL that is not loopback aborts the
 *      start. This is the check that makes the rest of it safe rather than
 *      merely careful.
 *   3. THE REVIEW ADAPTERS ARE TURNED ON, and the key that reaches them is
 *      generated here. `PLUTOBET_ENVIRONMENT=review` plus
 *      `PLUTOBET_REVIEW_ADAPTERS=1` let a local mailbox stand in for Termii and
 *      Resend, and let KYC uploads land in a directory this machine throws
 *      away — which is what makes registration, password reset, phone and email
 *      verification and document upload testable in a browser at all against a
 *      production build. `PLUTOBET_REVIEW_KEY` is what stops a CUSTOMER on this
 *      same server reaching that surface: the routes answer 404 without it. See
 *      `src/lib/review-mode.ts` for the four conditions and why the last of them
 *      cannot be forged.
 *   4. `AUTH_SECRET` and `IDENTITY_PEPPER` are REVIEW-ONLY values, generated on
 *      first run into a gitignored file. Previously the review process
 *      inherited the production pair from `.env`, which meant a local browser
 *      session was signed with the production secret and local identity numbers
 *      hashed into the production keyspace. Neither is needed to review a
 *      screen, and both are avoidable.
 *
 * The generated file is gitignored and never printed. If it is lost, delete it
 * and the next start makes another — the only cost is that existing local
 * sessions and local identity hashes stop verifying, which for a disposable
 * database is not a cost.
 *
 * `playwright.config.ts` still does not spawn this itself. The base URL is
 * supplied by whoever runs the suite, so pointing the tests somewhere is always
 * a deliberate act.

/*
 * EXTERNAL PROVIDER CREDENTIALS, BLANKED.
 *
 * `next start` loads `.env`, and this repository's `.env` holds PRODUCTION
 * provider credentials. Overriding the database was never enough on its own:
 *
 *   - B2_* is the KYC DOCUMENT BUCKET. The interaction suite uploads a KYC
 *     document, so a review run was writing test files into the production
 *     store of customers' identity documents.
 *   - ODDS_API_KEY is a live, metered provider. A review run spent real quota.
 *   - INNGEST_* is the production job queue, which settles bets.
 *   - UPSTASH_* is production Redis.
 *   - The TERMII_ and RESEND_ pairs would send a REAL SMS or email;
 *     `otp.service.ts` switches to a live sender the moment either pair is
 *     present, and the interaction suite registers accounts.
 *
 * Blanked, not deleted: `next start` re-reads `.env` in the child, and dotenv
 * leaves a name alone only when it is already DEFINED. An empty string is
 * defined; a deleted name is not, and would be refilled from the file.
 *
 * Every consumer treats empty as absent — `envCheck` in /api/health trims
 * before testing, and `factory.ts` falls back to the sandbox adapter — so the
 * review server runs with the same honest "unconfigured" behaviour a fresh
 * checkout has.
