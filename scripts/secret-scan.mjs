 * THE DESIGN CONSTRAINT
 * ---------------------
 * A scanner that prints the offending line publishes the secret into CI logs,
 * pull-request checks and anybody's terminal scrollback — turning a warning
 * into a second, more durable exposure. So the matched text NEVER leaves this
 * process. Findings are reported as file, line number and rule name only.
 *
 * That is also why matches are not echoed back for "context": there is no way
 * to show a credential's surroundings without showing the credential.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 findings, 2 the scanner itself failed.
