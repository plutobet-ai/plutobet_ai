 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
 * ----------------------------------
 * It does not price a bet. Total odds and potential return shown here are a
 * PREVIEW so the customer can see what they are about to submit; the server
 * recomputes both from the stored selection prices and its answer is the one
 * that counts. Duplicating the pricing rules in the browser is how a display
 * and a payout drift apart, and on a betting site that difference is a
 * customer complaint with a screenshot attached.
 *
 * It also never writes money. Placement goes to the existing authenticated
 * route, which owns validation, idempotency and the ledger.
 *
 * Persistence is `sessionStorage`, not `localStorage`: a betslip is a piece of
 * in-progress intent, not a saved document, and finding yesterday's picks
 * still loaded is confusing rather than helpful.
