   * Withdrawal deliberately permits a self-excluded customer, because trapping

   * and self-exclusion exists to stop wagering decisions. Nothing is trapped by
   * refusing it, because the bet still settles normally and still pays out. So
   * the rule is the same one placement uses: ACTIVE, and not excluded at the
   * identity level.
   *
   * The identity-level check matters separately from the status. Self-exclusion
   * is registered against a verified identity so it survives re-registration;
   * someone who excludes themselves and signs up again gets a fresh ACTIVE
   * account, and only `assertNotExcluded` catches them.
