/**
 * Placing a slip: single, accumulator, or system.
 *
 * A system expands into one ordinary accumulator per combination, so this
 * module is mostly bookkeeping around the existing placement service — which
 * is the point. Nothing below reimplements pricing, exposure, idempotency or
 * the ledger; those stay in the one place that is already proven.
 *
 * WHY EACH COMBINATION IS PLACED SEPARATELY RATHER THAN IN ONE TRANSACTION
 * Each combination is a real bet with its own stake debit and its own exposure
 * claim, and exposure is checked per market. A 6-combination system might have
 * four combinations accepted and two refused because a market filled up in
 * between — and that is the CORRECT outcome, not a failure. Forcing all six
 * into one transaction would mean a full market on one leg rejects a slip that
 * was mostly placeable.
 *
 * The customer is told exactly what was accepted and charged only for that.
