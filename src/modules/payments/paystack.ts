/**
 * Paystack adapter.
 *
 * ⚠️ UNVERIFIED AGAINST LIVE TRAFFIC. Every field mapping below follows
 * Paystack's published API shape and has been exercised only against fixtures.
 * The same caveat carried by the odds adapter applies, and for the same
 * reason: a field this code guesses wrong moves real money to the wrong place.
 * Run a low-value transfer end to end before trusting it with a customer's.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ADAPTER IS CAREFUL ABOUT
 *
 *  - Amounts. Paystack denominates NGN in kobo, which happens to match the
 *    internal representation exactly, so nothing is scaled. That coincidence
 *    is asserted rather than assumed: `toKobo` refuses a non-integer.
 *  - Idempotency. Every transfer carries our withdrawal id as its reference,
 *    so a retry maps to the same provider transfer instead of a second payout.
 *  - Failure shape. A network error and a declined transfer are different
 *    things, and only one of them is safe to retry.
