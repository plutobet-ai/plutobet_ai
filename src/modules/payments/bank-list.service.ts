/**
 * The list of banks a withdrawal can be paid to.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. The withdrawal form asked the customer to type a NIP
 * bank code from memory. A wrong code does not bounce — it sends real money to
 * a real account at a different institution, and the first anyone hears of it
 * is a support ticket about a missing withdrawal.
 *
 * WHY THE LIST IS NEVER WRITTEN DOWN HERE. Nigerian bank codes change: banks
 * merge, microfinance banks appear and are delisted. A list typed into source is
 * wrong from the day it is written and gets quietly worse. The provider is the
 * only source that is right by construction, because it is the same party that
 * will refuse or accept the transfer.
 *
 * CACHING, AND WHY IT IS LONG. A bank list changes a few times a year, and the
 * provider call costs a network round trip on a page a customer is waiting on.
 * Twelve hours is far shorter than the rate of change and long enough that the
 * provider is asked twice a day rather than once per withdrawal page view.
 *
 * WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE PROVIDER IS DOWN. The cached list is served past its
 * TTL rather than showing an empty form — a stale list of banks is materially
 * better than no list, since the codes in it were valid twelve hours ago and
 * the transfer itself re-validates. With no cache at all the route says so
 * honestly and the form falls back to accepting a typed code, which is what it
 * did before this existed.
