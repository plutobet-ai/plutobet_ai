/**

 * WHAT IS AT STAKE. A wrong bank code does not bounce. It sends real money to a
 * real account at a different institution, and the first anyone hears of it is a
 * support ticket about a missing withdrawal. So the list may only come from the
 * provider — the same party that will accept or refuse the transfer — and never
 * from a table typed into source, which is wrong from the day it is written.
 *
 * WHAT THESE TESTS DO NOT PROVE. Nothing here contacts Paystack. The adapter is
 * exercised against captured-shape fixtures, which pins OUR parsing and says
 * nothing about whether the provider still answers that way. Real communication
 * is `BLOCKED_BY_KEY` and stays so until credentials exist.
