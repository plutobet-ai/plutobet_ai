/**
 * Runs registered Inngest functions in-process, faithfully enough to test them.
 *
 * IT LIVES OUTSIDE `__tests__` BECAUSE TWO CALLERS NEED IT. The settlement
 * acceptance specs drive it from Vitest, and `/api/qa/settlement` drives it
 * from a REVIEW SERVER so a browser journey can watch a bet it placed through
 * the visible betslip reach WON, LOST or VOID through the registered functions
 * rather than through a direct call to `settleBet`. Nothing here is reachable
 * on a deployment: the route that imports it answers 404 unless the four
 * review-environment conditions and a per-run key are all satisfied.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHAT IT IS NOT
 * The settlement chain was only ever proven by calling its services directly,
 * which skips the registered function entirely — the part that had never
 * actually run. Testing the services proved the logic; it did not prove the
 * entry point wires them together.
 *
 * This drives `InngestFunction.fn`, the real handler, with a `step`
 * implementation modelling Inngest's own semantics:
 *
 *   step.run(id, fn)        -> await fn()          (memoised per run, as Inngest does)
 *   step.sendEvent(id, ev)  -> dispatch to whichever registered function
 *                              declares that event as its trigger
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT MODEL: durability, retries, backoff, or
 * cross-invocation memoisation. Those belong to the platform, and a test that
 * pretended to cover them would assert something this harness cannot know.
 * What it does prove is that the registered handler, its steps, the events it
 * emits and the functions those events reach form a working chain.

 * function from the top each time and serving completed steps from a
 * checkpoint. Code OUTSIDE a step therefore re-executes on every invocation.
 *
 * That difference destroyed a real customer's payout. The cadence claim — a
 * one-winner `SET NX` — sat outside `step.run`, so the second invocation found
 * the claim held by its own first invocation, returned "not due", and never
 * reached the dispatch. Every service-level test passed; so did a
 * single-invocation harness test.
 *
 * Here the memo map lives OUTSIDE the invocation loop, so a step executed in
 * invocation 1 is replayed from the checkpoint in invocation 2, and anything
 * outside a step runs again — exactly as in production.
 *
 * `maxInvocations` bounds it: a handler that never converges is a bug, not a
 * reason to loop forever.
