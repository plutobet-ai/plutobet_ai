 * own counter and N instances would each allow the full quota — the same

 *
 * Fixed windows rather than a sliding log: a sliding window needs a sorted
 * set per key and trims on every call, which costs more than it is worth for
 * abuse control. The known cost is burstiness at a window boundary, which is
 * acceptable here and is NOT acceptable for the odds budget — that one guards
 * a hard external quota, so it stays exact.
