 * issued. This is the second layer, and it exists because SameSite=Lax has
 * gaps a determined attacker can work in: a same-SITE subdomain is not
 * cross-site, and any future relaxation of the cookie would silently remove the
 * only defence there was.
 *
 * The browser security pass found the gap. A withdrawal posted with
 * `Origin: https://evil.example.com` was accepted with 201 — no cross-site
 * request could have produced that call, so it was not an exploitable finding,
 * but "the only thing stopping this is a cookie attribute" is a poor place for
 * a money route to be.
 *
 * ABSENT IS ALLOWED, DELIBERATELY. Browsers send `Origin` on every
 * state-changing fetch; native and server-to-server clients often send none.
 * Refusing an absent header would break those without stopping any attack,
 * because an attacker in a browser cannot omit it.
