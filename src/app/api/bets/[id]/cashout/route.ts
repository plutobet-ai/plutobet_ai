 * Cash-out: buying a bet back before it settles.
 *
 * TWO VERBS, AND THE DIFFERENCE MATTERS.
 *
 *   GET   prices the position and takes nothing. Read-only.
 *   POST  takes the offer. Moves money.
 *
 * They are separate because a quote is something a customer refreshes while
 * watching a match, and a route that priced and paid in one call would make
 * every refresh a payment.
 *
 * THE USER ID IS NEVER IN THE REQUEST. It comes from the authenticated session
 * through `authedRoute`, so no body, query string or header can cash out
 * somebody else's bet. The service checks ownership again under the bet's row
 * lock, because a boundary check alone is a check one refactor away from being
 * skipped.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ROUTE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not price anything, decide
 * eligibility, or touch a balance. Every one of those lives in
 * `CashOutService`, which is reachable from an admin tool and a background job
 * as well as from here — a rule enforced only at the HTTP edge is not enforced.
