                  called `router.refresh()`. The refresh re-rendered this list,
                  the ticket came back as CASHED_OUT, and the condition above
                  unmounted the component MID-SENTENCE — so the only plain
                  statement of what the customer had just been paid existed for
                  as long as one server round-trip and then vanished. A
                  `role="status"` node destroyed before a screen reader reaches
                  it has announced nothing at all, and a sighted customer was
                  left with a pill and a "Returned" column to infer from.

                  Rendering it from the SERVER's own view of the bet is what
                  makes it durable: it is still there after a reload, on a
                  second device, and a week later. The wording is identical to
                  the one the panel used, because the customer should not have
                  to notice that two different parts of the page said it.
