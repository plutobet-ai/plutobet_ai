 * cannot be shortened. Both are true of the SHARED demo account and true of
 * nothing else. These are the two most consequential controls a gambling
 * product has — the ones a person reaches for at their worst moment — and
 * "pressing it would be inconvenient for the suite" is the weakest possible
 * reason to have never pressed one.
