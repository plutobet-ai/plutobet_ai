/**
 * A sensitive administrative action, performed successfully — and refused
 * without its step-up.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MISSING. The admin suite proved a support agent is refused, that
 * every screen renders, and that an anonymous caller gets nothing. It never
 * once completed a privileged action, so "step-up authentication" was declared
 * an integration boundary on the grounds that a browser "can only show the
 * prompt". A browser can do considerably more than show the prompt: it can be
 * refused without one, then satisfy it, then succeed — which is the whole
 * control, in the order an operator meets it.
 *
 * APPROVING A PAYOUT is the right action to choose. It is the one where an
 * unlocked laptop must not be enough, it demands a written reason that lands in
 * the audit log, and it moves a customer's money. It also does NOT send the
 * money — approval moves the row to APPROVED and a worker picks it up — so
 * nothing here reaches a payment provider.
