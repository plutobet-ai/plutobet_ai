/**
 * INTERNAL_SECURITY_VERIFICATION — automated, against the disposable local stack.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a penetration test. Nobody creative sat down with
 * this system and tried to break it; a list of known attack shapes was fired at
 * it and the answers were recorded. That catches regressions in controls the
 * team already knows about and finds nothing nobody thought of, which is the
 * whole value of the human exercise. `general.md` keeps "independent
 * penetration test" as outstanding external work, and this file does not
 * discharge it.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. Evidence that the controls the security review claims are in
 * place answer correctly when probed through the real HTTP surface: no session,
 * another customer's object, a foreign redirect, an unsigned webhook, a replayed
 * idempotency key, a payload with fields the client should not choose.
 *
 * Every probe runs against loopback, on seeded disposable data. Nothing here
 * touches a provider, and nothing asserts a vulnerability was exploited — a
 * refusal is the pass condition throughout.
