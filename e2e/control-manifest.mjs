/**
 * The expected-control manifest.
 *
 * WHY A MANIFEST AT ALL. The interaction audit is generated from what the
 * browser did, which makes every row in it true — and says nothing about what
 * was never attempted. A generated report cannot tell you about the control
 * nobody wrote a test for. This file is the other half: a declared list of what
 * MUST be accounted for, so that "we tested everything we tested" becomes
 * "we tested everything we said existed".
 *
 * `scripts/check-control-coverage.mjs` compares this against the audit rows and
 * fails when a control marked `browser` has none.
 *
 * HOW TO ADD A CONTROL. Add the row here first. The check will fail, and that
 * failure is the point: it is the reminder to write the test. Deleting a row to
 * make the check pass is the one edit that defeats the whole file.
 *
 * COVERAGE KINDS
 *
 *   browser               must be clicked or submitted in a real browser
 *   blocked               the underlying feature needs a key, contract,
 *                         product decision or licence; the control is expected
 *                         to be absent, disabled, or to render an honest
 *                         unavailable state
 *   integration-boundary  cannot meaningfully exist in a browser, and is
 *                         covered by an integration test that is NAMED
 *   hidden                deliberately not rendered, because the feature does
 *                         not exist
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * THE REASON CODES, AND WHY THEY ARE A CLOSED LIST
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The previous version of this file required a `why` and accepted any prose.
 * That is exactly enough rigour to be defeated by a sentence, and it was: five
 * controls were classified as integration boundaries whose reason was, in
 * substance, "pressing this would break the rest of the run". Self-exclusion,
 * a cool-off, a password change, revoking a session, a KYC upload — all of them
 * irreversible for the account that performs them, all of them perfectly
 * testable on an account created three seconds earlier. That is a shared-
 * fixture problem, not an integration boundary, and a free-text field let it
 * wear the costume.
 *
 * So the reason is now a CODE from this list, and the checker enforces both
 * membership and the prose that must accompany it:
 *
 *   EXTERNAL_PROVIDER_KEY_REQUIRED
 *       A purchased credential is missing. Nobody can exercise the real
 *       behaviour without it, and a fixture standing in for it would be a
 *       fiction. The control renders an honest unavailable state.
 *
 *   COMMERCIAL_CONTRACT_REQUIRED
 *       A signed agreement with a third party is missing.
 *
 *   PRODUCT_DECISION_REQUIRED
 *       The owner has not defined the rule. Implementing one to make a test
 *       pass would invent a financial or product policy nobody agreed to.
 *
 *   REGULATION_REQUIRED
 *       A licence, certification or approval is missing.
 *
 *   TIME_BASED_COVERED_BY_DETERMINISTIC_INTEGRATION_TEST
 *       The behaviour happens after a delay a browser cannot wait out — a
 *       24-hour limit increase, a backoff schedule. The named test controls
 *       the clock. `why` MUST name the spec file.
 *
 *   IRREVERSIBLE_ACTION_TESTED_WITH_ISOLATED_DISPOSABLE_ACCOUNT
 *       The action cannot be undone for whoever performs it, and it IS
 *       performed — on an account created for that test alone. Used on
 *       `browser` rows, as a record of how the coverage was obtained, so that
 *       "it would break the suite" can never again be mistaken for a reason
 *       not to press something.
 *
 *   NON_VISUAL_INTERNAL_INVARIANT
 *       The property is not observable on screen at all: a combinatorial
 *       expansion, a lock ordering, a construction-time refusal, a lockfile
 *       audit. `why` MUST name the spec file that asserts it.
 *
 * A row whose reason does not appear here, or whose prose reads as
 * "the shared demo account would be inconvenient", is REFUSED by the checker.
