/**
 * The two refusals that decide whether money can leave: the KYC tier, and the
 * rolling daily cap.
 *
 * WHY EACH TEST OWNS AN ACCOUNT. "Requires an account at a specific KYC tier
 * with a specific day's history" was the previous reason for calling this an
 * integration boundary, and it is a correct description of the difficulty and a
 * poor reason not to do it. Constructing that state is three lines now, and the
 * refusal a customer actually sees — in the form, before the request, and again
 * from the server if they get past it — is not something an acceptance test on
 * the service can show.
 *
 * The caps come from `DEFAULT_WITHDRAWAL_LIMITS`: tier 0 cannot withdraw at
 * all, tier 1 is ₦50,000 a day, tier 2 is ₦500,000, tier 3 is ₦5,000,000.
